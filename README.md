# Bridgeable
Bridge any Swift type into Objective-C.

_Work In Progress_

### Update: Do not use this. The compiler makes type assumptions behind the scenes, and therefore this is unsafe. I saw this on twitter a while ago, will link when able.

Usage: See [BridgableTests.swift](https://github.com/JThramer/Bridgeable/blob/master/BridgeableTests/BridgeableTests.swift).
